## Problem/Issues to resolve
Our application aims to refine the e-commerce pipeline by providing useful tools for managing product prices, availability, and user transactions. Our program will provide a flexible interface for the admin to manage the sellers’ and customers’ transactions and information, the seller to manage the product information and offer discounts, and the user to purchase through access to a cart. Furthermore, proper authentication is in place to ensure confidentiality and security of the customer’s data. In all, our program strives to deliver effective and seamless operations for customers, sellers, and admin in an online environment.
## Operations
The e-commerce has 3 main users: admin, seller, and customer.
Admin:
- Manage the user's accounts (sellers and customers).
Seller:
- Add/ remove the products they want to sell (id, name, price).
- Manage the inventory.
- Handle returns and refunds.
- Customer Support.
- Give customer a special discount.
Customer:
- Search the product.
- Select or remove the product they want to buy.
- Payment.
- Returns and refunds.
- Reviews.
## Assumptions
The end user must be an e-commerce business seeking to ensure maximum customer satisfaction and ease of operation for the faculty/staff.  The admin, which requires special authentication, manages user’s accounts. The seller manages the product pricing and inventory. The user can view and purchase products.
## Operating environments
Our program will be built primarily using Java and is console-based.
## Intended usage:
The program will be used to benefit an e-commerce business by providing useful tools to manage customers and transactions, manage product information, offer product discounts for customers and staff, and provide an interface for viewing/buying products. The program provides an authentication process for all users (including admin, customer, seller).
## High-level description
Plan of approach in the program is to tackle each part of the e-commerce one at a time. We plan to tackle the seller’s section first as they will be the ones putting their product up and be the ones having the product that is being sold. On the side of the sellers we will be making it as easy as possible for them to put a product up, label, and price them in a simple way. From there they will be able to add any discounts or anything that they want to do with the product. Then we will approach the customer side and see how we can make it as easy as possible for them to find what they are looking for. Having things like discounted items show and a filter system that makes it easy to search. Then we will go to the admin side last because it is the place where all the data is being held. On the admin side we plan on having it be able to pull data out and be able to send data back as well when it is asked. The admin side will hold the customer information and the seller information. The admin side will be the side with a lot of data as that will be the place where everything goes in and out through. If anyone wants to edit, delete, or add information that they have this is where that can be granted access to do that from. 
## Functionality
- User login and authentication: Verify the user's identity and allow them to log into their account.
- Product search and browsing: Enables customers to search and browse products for sale and add them to the shopping cart.
- Payment processing: Once the customer completes the payment choice, the products are listed as purchased.
- Order viewing and return system: Customers can choose to return purchased items and receive a refund.
- Review and rating system: Customers can rate the products they have purchased.
- Product list page that sellers can view, edit, or delete their products: to adjust inventory.
- Option to provide special discounts: offer discounts to customers.
